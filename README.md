# ARrrrLib
A collection of Spark AR utility libraries

## Setup
When you're using FARLib as an external library for your own Studio AR project then make sure to copy the ```package.json``` and ```package-lock.json``` to the root of this library. This folder, although it's an external library will also need to have the node_modules installed to function. To install the ```node_modules``` you will have to run:
```javascript
npm i
```
The node_modules folder is ignored through the ```.gitignore``` which can be found in the root of FARLib.
