# Information about ARrrrLib
*ARrrrLib* (try saying it like a pirate) is a collection of utility libraries for Facebook's AR platform **Spark AR Studio**.
The 'Pièce de Résistance' is a complete and feature-rich tweening-library. It has a similar syntax as Greensock's TweenLite library. ARrrrLib also contains a few other gems that make developing a Spark AR filter a lot easier.

## Setup
When you're using FARLib as an external library for your own Studio AR project then make sure to copy the ```package.json``` and ```package-lock.json``` to the root of this library. This folder, although it's an external library will also need to have the node_modules installed to function. To install the ```node_modules``` you will have to run:
```javascript
npm i
```
The node_modules folder is ignored through the ```.gitignore``` which can be found in the root of FARLib.
